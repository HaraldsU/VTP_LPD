The wording and order of these arguments can be confusing, but remember that the underlying fallacy here is the deduction of an ought from an is. We go against nature (or what is) all the time. We cannot sometimes use nature as a moral baseline and at other times condemn her for her careless attitude and indifference toward the human race.",

The universal claim here is that no UbaTuba White Men's Club member will ever (universal) go to jail.  Marvin points out how clearly this is counterfactual as there are many UbaTuba White Men's Club members in jail.  Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, the implication that no ""UbaTuba White Men's Club members"" is changed to “no true UbaTuba White Men's Club members”, which is not meaningful because John’s definition of a “true UbaTuba White Men's Club member” apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if an UbaTuba White Men's Club member goes to jail.
