Such regulation is the first step to confiscation of all weapons and the elimination of our constitutional right to bear arms. Ted: This is preposterous. Many things in society are registered, such as cars, babies, boats, and lanes, yet these items have never been confiscated.","","Ted is making a faulty analogy between registration of guns and registration of cars and babies. But guns are frequently used as instruments of intentional violence and therefore may be more likely targets for confiscation. John is making a slippery slope argument that registration of firearms must invariably lead to the elimination of a constitutional right."

The universal claim here is that no UbaTuba White Men's Club member will ever (universal) go to jail.  Marvin points out how clearly this is counterfactual as there are many UbaTuba White Men's Club members in jail.  Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, the implication that no ""UbaTuba White Men's Club members"" is changed to “no true UbaTuba White Men's Club members”, which is not meaningful because John’s definition of a “true UbaTuba White Men's Club member” apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if an UbaTuba White Men's Club member goes to jail.

The term “heavy” does not have an objective standard, yet we have no problem using that term in a meaningful way.  In fact, very few relational terms have any kind of objective foundation. Ken: But without an objective morality, we would all be lost morally as a race. Rob: Many would say that we are. Ken: But how can you say that torturing children for fun is morally acceptable in any situation? Rob: Personally, I wouldn’t, but you are implying that anything that is not objective must necessarily be seen in all possible ways. A feather may not be seen as “heavy” to anyone, but that doesn’t mean its “lightness” is still not relative to other objects. Ken: But God is the standard of objective morality.  Prove that wrong! Rob: That I cannot do."," Ken starts with a statement explaining why he thinks there has to be an objective morality -- a statement based on a reasonable argument that can be pursued with reason and logic.  Rob adequately answers that objection, as indicated by Ken’s move away from that objection to a new objection.  This pattern continues until we arrive at an impossible request.  Despite all the objections being adequately answered, at no time does Ken concede any points or abandon the argument.",""
